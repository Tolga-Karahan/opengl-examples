Some projects that I completed in CTIS 164 - Technical Mathematics with Programming course. (OpenGL, C, GLUT)

## Lighting simulation project
User can select one of two types of light source namely point light source and spotlight light source. The light source swings like a pendulum. The surface is modeled by many circles with the radius of 10 pixels. The colors of the circles are calculated based on the light source properties. The color of the light source is white. The brightness (sum of red, green and blue) is represented by arrows. For the spotlight, cut-off/field of view angle is 30 degree.
